## Summary
There are a few limitations to this webpage. One noticable issue is that partial matches wont show, only exact matches. Another is that we are working with only imported data from US sightings, rendering the "Country" search pretty useless.

A few recomendations for changing this are to add data for multiple countries, and add functionality for partial matches. We could add more worldwide data here to bring more function into our search parameters. We could also add a legend of Shapes used so individuals could search easier as well.
